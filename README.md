==========

A simple cost estimator forked from the mcknightg/meteorshop repo.

Meteorshop is a solid foundation for learning the basic design/construction of a meteor app. It lacked any UI to add/update/delete from the products, categories, subcategories, etc. collections, so I'm using this as an opportunity to learn Meteor.

Because my initial focus is on updating the database most of my changes are focused on adding form templates for modal popups, template helpers and meteor methods to support the server updates. I've also had to refactor the collections to use SimpleSchema and Autoform. These still need some work.
